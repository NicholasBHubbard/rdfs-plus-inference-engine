#+title: RDFS-Plus inference engine
#+author: Nicholas Hubbard

* Overview
 Static inference engine for the RDFS-Plus modeling language defined in
 [[https://workingontologist.org/index.html][Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist]].

* Disclaimer
  If you actually need an RDFS-Plus inference engine there are better options
  out there. This is just a toy project that I created for fun to help me learn
  Prolog.

  This code is written specifically for SWI-Prolog and makes no promises to run
  on any other Prolog implementation.

* Features
  + Static inference engine 
  + Parse [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)][turtle files]] into pure rdf 
  + Performs contradiction analysis

* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC
rdfs-plus-inference-engine/main File.ttl
#+END_SRC
This command outputs a file named =File.ttl.inferred=.

You may get an error about not having the =reif= library installed, in which
case you must start up swipl and run =pack_install(reif)=.
