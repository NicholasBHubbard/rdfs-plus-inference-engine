#+title: RDFS-Plus inference engine
#+author: Nicholas Hubbard

** Overview
 Static inference engine powered by SWI-Prolog for the RDFS-Plus modeling language
 defined in [[https://workingontologist.org/index.html][Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist]]. 

* State of the Project
  All predicates for creating new rdf/3 triples and analyzing for
  contradictions based off RDFS-Plus have been implemented. The final step for
  completion of the project is to figure out an algorithm to compute all
  possible inferences.

* Features
  + Static inference engine 
  + Parse [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)][turtle files]] into pure rdf 
  + Performs contradiction analysis
  + /tbd/

* Workflow
Simply run your turtle files against NAME_TBD and you will either get error
messages about all the mistakes you have made, or you will get a new file with a
/.inferred/ extension that is a copy of the original file with all
inferred triples appended.
